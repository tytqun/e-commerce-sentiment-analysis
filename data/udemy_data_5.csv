Very comprehensive and thorough course indeed!I had opted for beta version of the exam , and regarding exam contents, I would say that deep understanding of core ML and data engineering concepts were extremely crucial in the test, more than AWS in general. Thus I really appreciate now, after the fact, how Frank takes us through the process of learning assuming we don't know anything regarding ML and data science, which was the case for me when I started!
