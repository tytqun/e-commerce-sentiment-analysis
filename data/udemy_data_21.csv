udemy_data (21).xlsx,https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-machine-learning-practice-exam/?couponCode=LETSLEARNNOW,aws-machine-learning-practice-exam,Matthew A.,"These exams are just ok. They cover a wide variety of topics, but explanations are highly inconsistent in quality. A few questions have answer choices that don't match the question, while others make unstated assumptions that effectively determine the correct answer. These exams also test rote memorization more than most others at the expense of testing conceptual knowledge. There are more questions here about specific Sagemaker settings and exact details of file formats than in any other practice exams I have tried.",3.0,5.0,1 month ago

For example I experienced 3 questions in the first 20 questions in the full test that require me to select answer based on specific details, but those details like ""require of x condition"" or ""response within x seconds"" are important when selecting the answer, and used in the answer explanation, but they are actually not in the question itself.

I passed the exam yesterday (June 30th). It is challenging, for a moment I started doubting if I would pass. When I was taking this practice exam I would finish with plenty of time to spare, not the actual exam I almost used all of the time. Time management is key, do not get stuck on trying to answer a question, flag it and move on. I was doing well on the first half of the exam, in my calculations I was going to have an hour to review the flagged questions, I did not. I had enough time to review the questions but barely. Depending on your experience this may not be the case for you. I took the official practice exam(I passed) a few days before the actual exam. I used the result to review areas with the lowest scores.",4.5,5.0,5 years ago

A lot of the credit goes to Frank for creating such a wonderful test set. The length and complexity of the questions and the module-wise question split in this course is very similar to that of the actual exam. The only difference is that in the actual exam the answers are even more close and confusing, in the sense that around 30% questions were too close to call and I had to use every iota of my memory , logic and general ML experience to finalize the answer. But this is only a minor issue since so far this is the best question set I have found on internet - way better than linuxacademy , acloudguru and AWS Official Practice exam( yes I took their tests as well). All in all very good place to test yourself once you have mastered the ML skills through various other courses , hands-on and AWS docs.
