The course uses an outdated version of LangGraph, and most examples and projects are directly taken from the documentation. The author claims this is an advanced course not intended for beginners, yet he frequently repeats himself and spends too much time covering LangChain basics that could be skipped. Every project starts with an identical setup video—why not make a single video for that instead of repeating the same process for each project? The course description advertises 6 hours of content, but in reality, only 3-4 hours consist of actual material, mostly taken from the documentation.
